# vue-chat-app

# How it works?
  This app was made with the firebase realtime database, with this anyone that logs in 
  will receive all previus messages sent before the person enters the chat. 

  If someone re-logs in the message they sent will appear in the right side of the app,
  and each other's messages will be displayed on the left side of the screen
